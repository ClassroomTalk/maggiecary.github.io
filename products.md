Maggie has been developing children's educational products since My Potty Game was first published by Rock A Bye Baby, Inc. in 1991.

After working as a consultant for a company that manufactured children's products she returned to the classroom. She currently teaches first grade but continues to create innovative games and books for elementary school children.
